## Description

Every vendor needs a point-of-sale product, so we have created the new and improved On Sale POS product featuring a package of predefined product sales options to make it easier for a vendor to put products on sale.

Upon installation of On Sale, the system is preloaded with all of the vendor's products. However, we know that product lines can change, so we've implemented features to update the product line with ease.
