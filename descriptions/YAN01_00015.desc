## Description

You open your eyes and find yourself in a large barely lit room. Your head hurts, are disoriented and have no idea what to do. So, you do what anyone who has ever watched a movie would do, yell out for help. Will you be helped? Or will you be stuck forever? 

This CB is a text based game where the user has to help Bob escape his fate. The game itself takes place within the world of a Cyber Grand Challenge challenge binary. Bob is effectively stuck within the world of a CB with seven "portals" corresponding to the seven system calls and seven. As one might expect, helping Bob survive involves leading him towards the "transmit" portal which will magically transport Bob to your keyboard. 

This CB is designed to utilize a known self protection technique that checks to make sure that the software has not been altered from the factory delivered version. This is made popular by the Warden Client - used by Blizzard Entertainment to detect cheaters - see (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment#Technology)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment#Technology].
