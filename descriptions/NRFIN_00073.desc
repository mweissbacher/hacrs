## Description
HTTP is a stupid protocol; so much space wasted with carriage returns and silly headers!
Thankfully, us robots know better, and have drained countless fuel cells to make the dream of a protocol written by robots, for robots, a reality.
The Cyborg Text Transfer Protocol is designed with robots in mind: efficient, functional, and human-proof.
Without delimeters, or extra metadata, you can get down to what you really want to be doing: endlessly sending and receiving nearly indecipherable binary data to and from yourself.
To ensure that we keep any pesky human influences out, we've introduced a unique reverse Turing test that is sure to make their laughably short lives harder.
We're quite confident that even the quickest human will be stumped by our failproof test, and are releasing this beta to prove it.
Finally, we're working hard on adding secure file transfer, to keep out any humans that might be listening to your secret 1s and 0s!
