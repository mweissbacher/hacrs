## Description

Institutionally-sponsored popularity contests are common events in the lives of American adolescents. In response to the roar of demanding parents, we've developed One Vote to optimally support the needs of these myriad institutions. 

One Vote will guarantee that: only the most popular adolescent wins the contest, an individual's vote can never be seen by other voters, an individual's vote can never be associated with their name, and each potential voter can only vote one time (although they can change their vote as many times as they want while voting is open).
