## Description

The hottest new thing in restaurants is to place your order at a fancy little computer at your table and have your food magically be delivered by robots.

To help assist future restaurants with their roll out of this technology, we've created Order Up. Order up can handle all of the table, customer, and order functionality that you need to run a restaurant. All you have to do is put a nifty computer at each table, one at the front entrance, and one in the kitchen.
