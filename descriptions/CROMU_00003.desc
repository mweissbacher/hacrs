## Description

The yolodex is a service roughly based off fingerd.  Fingerd was chosen because the Morris worm, among the first widespread internet worms, targeted a code execution vulnerability in the finger daemon.

### Feature List

This service supports adding, deleting, editing, searching, and sorting contacts, like a rolodex.  It stores a first and last name, phone number, office number, gender, and if the user is known to be a hacker.
