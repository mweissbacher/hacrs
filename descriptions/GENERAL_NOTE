Some programs are very complex to interact with. To try to help you out, we've
compiled together a list of common tricks to trigger functions in programs:

- Some programs don't interact using English, but receive, as an input, single
  letters and numbers, triggering different functions for them.
- Some programs are *case sensitive*. That is, they treat uppercase letters and
  lowercase letters differently. If a program is not behaving as expected, try
  provide a different case for the letters.

In general, if the number of triggered functions is increasing, you are on the
right track!

To help you with understanding how to interact with these programs, we have
provided several "sample interactions" below. Please skim over them; it'll help
you understand the programs, and also understand what functions have already
been triggered. If a function has already been triggered in a different
interaction, it *will not* count toward your payout. 

There are multiple interactions below. You can click on the link corresponding
to its number, then skim it. User input into the program is displayed in black
font, and output in red font. When an input character seen in the interaction
can be changed to change the program's behavior, it will be highlighted in
different colors depending on how these changes can occur. Hovering your mouse
over these highlights will display a table describing what the character can be
replaced with to trigger different functions in the program. For example, if a
character "F" is highlighted, and hovering over it displays "<'F'" as a possible
alternative, then you might be able to enter "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E" to
trigger different functions.

For the purpose of the less than ("<") and greater than (">") alternatives,
please use the following ranking (from least to greatest) of the letters:

ENTER TAB SPACEBAR ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~

After you have familiarized yourself with the sample interactions,
you can collapse the existing interactions, click on the bar above the black
textbox to enable it, and begin interacting with the software. Alternatively,
if you want replay a prior transition, simply click on an input character,
and everything until that character will be replayed in the session!

Good luck!
