## Description
This binary mimics the function in sendmail that was vulnerable to CVE-2002-1337 commonly known as the crackaddr bug. Sendmail is an email server originally published in 1983. The CVE-2002-1337 was a buffer overflow in the crackaddr function for email address parsing. In 2011, 8 years after the bug was published, security researcher Thomas Dullien (AKA Halvar Flake) showcased the bug as something static analysis tools were unable to detect and created a simplified implementation to demonstrate that point. Since then, multiple teams have used the crackaddr bug as a litmus test for the real world viability of analysis tools. To date some tools have been able to detect the vulnerability in the simplified version but not the original. This implementation closely mimics the original bug in sendmail.  

### Feature List
The crackaddr function in sendmail was created to parse addresses with a complex combination of embedded parenthesis, angle brackets, quotes, and grouping syntax. The function recreated here adds in some additional complexity from the original function and changes all the special characters to other ascii values.
