## Description

SafeTechs is proud to announce the latest in our ever-expanding line of cloud offerings: GreatView, a memory-as-a-service (MaaS) technology that allows you to easily expand the amount of memory to a local application.
As an added benefit, you can retrieve this stored data in any number of supported views, abstracting away all the hassle of converting endianess and data types.


### Feature List

Using our patent-pending array management language, you can quickly and easily store and retrieve arbitrary values in any way that you so choose.
Because all the data is stored in memory, and our servers are located in some of the fastest data centers in the world, you can be certain that you can access this data as fast as possible.
