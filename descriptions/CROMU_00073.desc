## Description

This binary accepts tuning parameters for a homemade PRNG, validates their
randomness with a Monte Carlo method to calculate pi, and uses the PRNG to
size a stack buffer for a relatively simple buffer overflow.

### Feature List

* Floating-point PRNG
* Monte Carlo simulation calculating pi
* Dynamically-sized stack buffer
