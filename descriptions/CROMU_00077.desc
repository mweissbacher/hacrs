## Description

This service is a reimplementation of a previous network file system. This version uses C++ and a completely rewritten file system that instead of being inode based uses a database storage backend method consisting of C++ classes and linked lists. All the same features are supported including the ability to login/logout, read/write, open, close, rename, and delete a file. These commands are provided via a custom binary protocol that allows a user to perform these actions against the file system on up to 10 files. Directory support is not supported however read/write permissions and file owner are supported in this service. Entropy from the magic page is added to the service by generating the unix timestamps for file creation via a generator function and magic page data.

### Feature List

This service features a binary protocol with 7 available commands: These are Login, Directory, Read, Write, Write Append, Delete and Rename. These commands operate on a back-end database file system that allows up to 10 maximum files to be written. Each file can be up to 1MB in size. Files are stored in a linked list of nodes. The Login command takes a username and password and allows the user to access the network file system and send the remaining commands. Directory provides a directory listing of files on the file system including name, creation timestamp, file size, owner, and file permissions. Read allows the user to read from a file at a specific offset and length. Write allows a user to write to the file with a specific length (and will create a new file if one does not already exist). Write append allows the user to append data to the end of the file. Delete will delete an existing file and takes a file name. Rename allows the user to rename a file on the file system to a new name.
