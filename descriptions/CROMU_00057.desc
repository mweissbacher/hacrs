## Description

This service implements a backend database for a Scrum software development management tool.  As the backend, it doesn't present a user interface, but instead provides a binary protocol for a frontend application to use.

### Feature List

The database is designed to store a number of "products" and the requirements and tasks associated with their Agile development.  Once a Product is defined, user requirements are stored in the Product Backlog.  Sprints are also added to the Product to group user requirements into small blocks of development & test efforts.  Requirements are moved from the Product Backlog to one of the defined Sprints.  Once assigned to a Sprint, these Sprint Backlog Items can be updated to reflect changes that naturally occur during development as complexity and requirements are better understood.  Backlog items can only be changed if they are assigned to a Sprint!  However, Backlog items (requriements) can only be deleted from a Product if they are not assigned to a Sprint, i.e. they are on the Product Backlog.  Sprints can also be deleted from the Product, but only if all Backlog items have been moved back to the Product Backlog or to another Sprint.  This is to avoid the inadvertent deletion of user requirements or Product developement tasks.  The only exception to this is if the Product itself is being deleted.  In this case, all Product details, including populated Sprints are deleted from the database. The database tool will also output the entire Product in a consolidated report that lists Product, Sprint, and Product Backlog details.
