## Description

For all of the authors who write all of their documents in VI, we've created the String Info Calculator. Not everybody has a fancy GUI word processing tool handy when writing a research paper or a book report. And we strongly believe that ALL authors need to be able to determine the statistics of their writing. How else are they going to meet the demanding parameters of their editors?
