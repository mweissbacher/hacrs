## Description

This service attempts to mirror a database service with expression based searching. This implementation supports 4 database records (firstname, lastname, username, and birthdate) in the internal database. Various commands are allowed to insert, remove, print, update, and find records in the database. The find command supports a relatively lightweight expression parser allowing operators to formulate simple expressions to find entries in the database such as (lastname == "Will" AND firstname == "Bob") would be an example expression.

### Feature List

This service supports database access update, removal, printing, and finding via relatively simple expressions. The database supports 4 entries for each record: firstname, lastname, username and birthdate. Birthdates are stored as month/day/year hour:minute:second. The search expressions (initiated by the find command) allow the formulation of multiple expressions with adjoining operators such as (firstname == "Joe" AND birthdate < 1/3/1990 10:33:43) is an example expression. Operators supported are ==, !=, >, and < for the database elements and AND and OR for joining result lists.
