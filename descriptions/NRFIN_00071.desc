## Description

SafeTechs realizes that our clients have files worth protecting, but today, there's no good way to transfer files securely and safely.
We're here to help you do it.
After years of work, we have created SBTP, a new way to transfer any data you want, and it will be encrypted, stay encrypted, and well outside the reach of any would-be hackers.
In addition, we've created a Patent-Pending binary verification tool that will ensure you're running the latest, safest version of SBTP.
Today, we've released the beta version of our application, and are offering free accounts on our server for anyone who wants to keep their data safe.
