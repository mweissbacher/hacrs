## Description

Ski resorts now have gates equipped with RFID sensors at every lift entrance that scan riders to verify their lift pass before the rider can board the lift. The side benefit of this technology is that resorts can accurately track rider numbers on each lift to glean important statistics.

Our exciting new software, Resort Modeller, works on the back-end to allow Resort staff to model different lift usage scenarios based on varying numbers of riders. This will help Resort owners make important planning and staffing decisions.
