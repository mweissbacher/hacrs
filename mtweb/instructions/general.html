<p>
Dear participant, welcome to our human-guided program analysis experiment.
The goal of these tasks is to help us find programming errors in computer programs.
We do not require input on any personal information.
</p>

<p>
We ask you to reach as many different areas of a program (program states) as possible to increase "code coverage" (the percentage).
The programs are executed on our computer, you will use them through the browser.
No installation is necessary.
</p>

<p>
The HIT will be completed once you reach the threshold of code coverage.
Then you qualify for payout.
However, we give bonus payments to top performers per task (highest percentage reached).
</p>

<p>
We offer many tasks with different complexity and payout.
They also cover many different computer programs.
