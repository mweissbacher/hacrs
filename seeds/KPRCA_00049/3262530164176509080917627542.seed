Hi
delete-note Let's
create-note Hello
new-note I can not believe Trump is going to be president. I'm genuinely scared about what's going to happen to America and the world. Hate crimes are already starting to rise. I can only hope that people don't just sit by and let people hurt others. I'm also scared, as a woman, about what kind of behavior will be deemed acceptable behavior toward me and others. What is happening to the world?
